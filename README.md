v0.3 - Added a timer
     - Added automatic anonymous firebase signin to each unique session
     - All sessions are now reactive to the database 'single source of truth'
     - Values reset every 30 seconds.
v0.2 - Pie chart now looks way cooler - changed colors and added a lighting effect.
v0.1 - Pie chart displays and reacts in real time! Neat.
